<!--
    This file contains information determined by hardware design and
    assembly of a specific board.

    What belongs here:
    - components, blocks and features that are present on the board
    - connections between components
    - fixed parameters important for software, like oscillator frequency

    What does not belong here:
    - parameters configurable from software, like UART baud rate.

    If a board has different assembly variants (e.g. different MCU versions
    or lack of certain components), separate variants of this model should
    be created as well.
